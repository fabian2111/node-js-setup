    <div class="recent">
        <h2>Recent things I did</h2>
        <p>Recently I went to a couple of national parks such as Yosemite and Sequoia since I live close to them. 
        The national parks had beautiful views and when I was there, I would go on hikes and look around the trail.

                    <h3>Yosemite</h3>
                    <p>Yosemite National Park had many great views and many famous landmarks. I took the first picture that overlooks El Capitan and the valley below.
                        It was a great view and it really showed many of landmarks that Yosemite has. What I like to do in Yosemite is go on hikes since they offer
                        nice views and some of them can be difficult. One of the hikes that I went on was called "Lower Yosemite Falls" which is the second picture.

                    <h3>Sequoia</h3>
                    <p>Sequoia National Park was also a really beautiful place and when I went, it was snowing a lot. It had really big trees
                        and had a good amount of open space to play around in the snow. I also went on a trail in which I saw many of these trees with some nice rivers.
                        This park had many areas where you can relax and when it is winter, you are able to go sledding which me and my friends did.

                    <h3>Bass Lake</h3>
                    <p>While it is not a national park, it is near Yosemite and it was a nice chill spot. I mostly
                        just relaxed at the lake and went on some trails. It was a nice experience to relax and view the lake.
                        It is near where people would usually camp and I had some fun times when I went camping.
